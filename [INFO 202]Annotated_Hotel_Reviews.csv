14670,4.6,"Fist impression was very bad and it was my trip to Brussels. When we arrived, there was no lobby, no reception, no concierge... only a counter with one person and not even with a hotel uniform. This was more like rent a room rather than a 3star hotel as it is advertised. The hotel’s webpage says nothing about the renovations and Booking.com  says that construction will end by Sept 10, which was not true, not even close. The room does NOT have air conditioner so if you want to rest during your vacations this is not the place. It has a fan (not a ceiling fan) not big enough to keep the room cool and if you leave the glass door open you will listen all the noise from the street and also all the light will come inside the room. I sweated all night. Bed and pillow are not confortable. There is no an ice machine. The day we left the only elevator thy have was not working to take the luggage down. For the approx. $125 per night that I paid, or maybe paying a little more, I would have find a much better place. I did not move to another place because of cancellation fees and looking for a hotel at last moment would cost much more. I definitely don’t recommend this place. The only good things it has is the location. ,

19695,5.4,"We had to order and pay for our breakfasts for the two days in advance, 15 euro per person. The breakfast was very poor value for money indeed. No choice of cereal, just corn flakes in a plastic tube. The cheese slices curled at the edges, no fruit. Just orange juice (no choice), cornflakes, roll with some ham and cheese and coffee. 15 euro!! We have stayed in Yores hotels before so know that by comparison this was VERY poor!  On the last morning, there were no cereal bowls or cereal - we had to ask for some. The stairs to bedrooms share access to the cafe WC!  The door was always open with a constant spell of urine etc emanating up the stairs. The stairs and bannisters were wobbly and insecure. Both bedrooms had curtains which did not close properly due to missing hooks. The carpets needed a good clean. Two of our party were in their early 80s. We were on the 2nd floor which they could manage okay but there was no light up the final three steps - it was broken - and though we pointed this out it was not fixed.
Paid staff were friendly but the owner was not - no welcome or enquiry as to our stay. 
The whole stay at Old Tom was a big disappointment.,

21741,7,"The pillows were a bit strange and uncomfortable - they seemed to be made of blocks of foam. The windows had to be propped open in order to let any air in (although being directly on the street was a bit noisy to have the windows open anyway). There was dirt in the corner of the room when we arrived, but otherwise the room and bathroom were clean. The bathroom had no window or exhaust fan (and also no candle or air freshener) and plumbing is very loud if you are a light sleeper. Plumbing can be heard also when other rooms shower or use the toilet. Also, the hairdryer did not function well and the water in the shower took about a minute and a half to finally become warm. The check in staff is a bit unfriendly and the website says they speak English, Spanish, French, and Dutch. We tried English, Dutch, and Spanish but only French was actually possible. The website also says checkout is 11:00am, but it is actually 10.30, which is quite early in our experience. Unfortunately, our room was one of the rooms that did not receive a wifi signal.,

The view was wonderful and the location was excellent. Overall, this is a very, very basic room in a great location on the river for a decent price during the summer high season. Free parking within 50-100m was a nice bonus.",1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0
7804,10,"The main things to consider before booking this boutique hotel are the fairly strict conditions in comparison with larger city centre hotels, in particular a 30-day cancellation policy and little flexibility of the timing of your check-in, as staff is only present at breakfast and during certain hours of the afternoon to receive new guests. The premises are fully covered by CCTV. If you can live with those restrictions, and if you don't mind climbing stairs, then you will have an absolutely wonderful stay.
Perhaps a small point of improvement might be the stability of the Wifi connection in the top floor suite, but the network connectivity in the common area was excellent.,

Loved the smell of freshly baked croissants every morning, as well as the overall help-yourself-at-any-time attitude of this boutique hotel, which does indeed make it an ""all in one"" experience. Coming home from work, you can make yourself a coffee or choose from a range of exquisite teas, and there will be some cookies and cake to accompany your beverage, which you enjoy in a beautiful salon with art on the walls and glossy magazines.
A special thanks to staff, who noticed within two minutes of my departure that I had forgotten my laptop in the room and took the trouble of reaching me on mobile to ensure I wouldn't leave without it. A personal touch that exemplifies the bliss of staying in a small boutique hotel with caring hosts.",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
2544,7,"Despite initially looking at this hotel for me trip, I went with the Radisson due to brand loyalty, however when informed of the renovation works I changed my booking to this hotel.
 Had to pay a 77 Euro upgrade because my room wasn't ready on arrival despite contacting them ahead. Got a Junior Suite which was spacious with a courtyard view, bedroom separate from bathroom and a mini hallway area,
Although it was very disappointing that a second bed wasn't placed in a lounge area as we were staying with my son, we had to share the bedroom with him, and in my opinion and experience in a suite their should be two sleeping areas. I also thought the bed whilst quite comfortable were tiny, my wife and I shared a supposed double bed and we barely fit it.
Also because staying with my son, it would have been nice to take advantage of room service, but the price was ludicrous, starting at 6 Euro for a espresso, so this was completely prohibitive, also be aware the hotel lists spa and fitness centre, whilst a basic gym is available the Spa actually doesnt belong to the hotel and you have to pay a 25 Euro surcharge per day to access it.,

19150,7,"- Even though we were the only ones using our shower (thus private), it was in the ground floor (we were in the attic) which made our staying uncomfortable since we had a small kid. 
- Our private bathroom was also in the ground floor. Another bathroom existed in the first floor (below our bedroom) but it was shared.
- The ladder leading out of bedroom (in the attic) was steep and not very convenient for a small toddler and a pregnant woman (like I am). 
- The ""seaview"" characterization is theoretically true but in practice it's just a small portion of sea viewable from a small window in the attic. 
- Wifi was not strong in the attic where we spent most of our time, when staying in the house. If Wifi is necessary for you, you have to go to the ground floor/public space.,

- Very pleasant and welcoming hosts. 
- Free parking.
- Good common facilities (spacious kitchen and breakfast room and nice/calm terrace).
- Proximity to the sea, only 3 minutes walking distance. 
- Breakfast was good (fried egg, ham/cheese/bread, salmon tranches, coffee & juice, cereals, milk and pastries).
- Even though we didn't use them, there were some nice amenities like the shauna and the jacuzzi. The host was kind enough to borrow us a bike for free.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,-1

As mentioned by so many guests earlier, (even though we didn’t have an issue)the only disadvantage is that there are no lifts as it’s a typical Belgian style house , so people who have difficulty to climb stairs should think twice
,

I would write a novel on what we liked if you want!
Catherine is a lovely host who has it all.
Right from welcoming to planning our best spots in Brugges ( she taught us to pronounce it as BBrrrrugheee)
Spotlessly clean rooms and you have the lower floors with a dining and living space (not to forget the garden) done in a classical style.
Nice old music playing from Beatles to Bob
Map with a great explanation of what to and what not to do in the short time we had
Good suggestions for chocolate places, restaurants
This place knows what they are doing 
They are into real hospitality which has been lost along by so many hosts.
She was like a Mother hen taking care of our every single need to the extend that she even booked us a taxi to the train early in the morning 
This has made us thinking already of going back to Brugges again
Breakfast- homely, top quality and enough quantity.
24x7 free coffee machine/tea/chocolates 
Lovely beds
Large and ulterior clean toilets

23222,2.9,"This hotel is situated in North Brussels, and I was concerned when I walked from the train station to the hotel and passed row after row of sex shops with girls in the windows selling their 'services'. There were lots of dubious looking groups of men hanging around on the street which made me feel uncomfortable walking to and from the hotel.
The room was basic - which is to be expected with a 2 star, but there was a smear of what can only be described as human excrement on the wall, the shower leaked all over the floor as there was a gaping hole in the bottom of the base, we did not have any towels provided on the first night, and the view from our window was an adjacent roof ledge from the building next door which was scattered with empty vodka bottles, nitrous oxide canisters and spoons which I will leave to the imagination the use.
Our first night was interrupted by the fact that the room next door decided to throw a room party with loud blaring rap music and shouting/singing which despite trying to ring reception (From our mobile as the room phone didn't work) went on until 5am, with our calls to reception going unactioned. 
I get that this hotel is cheap in comparison to others, however it is still expensive for the stay we received, and next time I would pay the extra to stay somewhere nicer.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1

GREAT !!
The Staff were more than great And Helpful we were there during ‘la Tour de France 2019’ and the roads leading to the hotel were closed the hotel sent us one of the employees ‘Alban’ to guide us through the crazy traffic he walked more than half an hour to reach us and another 1 hour in the car trying to figure out the quicker and less busier road to the hotel.
When we reach the hotel the Concierge Team welcomed us warmly with dozens of suggestions on how to spend the next 3 days in Brussels Specially Haluk et Jean in numerous instances they literally went out of the hotel with us to show how to reach a restaurant / Attraction - to my surprise the Concierge Team consist 6 personnel each specialized in a special area... and by the way they were extending the same service to all hotel Guests with the same unprecedented positive attitude at any time of the day.
With the hundreds of hotels that I have stayed with  during my travels I can easily say that I have never experienced a more professional concierge service like the one I have received from The Concierge Team at Amigo Rocco Forte.
In a nutshell. Great Location, Magnificent Concierge Team , Super clean Room and First Class Service from Doorman, Concierge , housekeeping till the Manager of the Hotel who was in the lobby most of the time.

11814,1,"The owner of the hotel was rude and the overall cleanliness of the room we were allocated was disgusting. The carpet was stained, the window was broken and taped up and the dust had been there for ages. The TV didn't work and the room was remotely like anything I had seen when looking for accommodation, we requested a different room he said he didn't have any. He informed me I had booked a double and that was what he gave me. He was then told that I had asked for double or a twin but certainly not a dirty room.  He said there was nothing he could do, he didn't have rooms like those advertised that was just booking.com making things up to get more people in. He eventually moved us to one of those rooms but it was still dirty with mould inside the cabinet in the bathroom and towels you could shoot peas through.  There were glass rings on the furniture which was covered in dust and the state of the radiators was sickening. I took a video or the first room and a couple of photos of the second room. We lived out of our suitcases for the 4 days & we were there on our own there were no other guests.

I wast able to increase to control the heat it was locket at a max I wanted it a little warmer because of my sinus. The washroom was ok but very old you can tell it is rusted need to be updated. There was a bit dust here and there and wear and tear on the walls and window. But those are really only details that some people that worked in the industry like myself would notice. My partner liked the room said was comfortable and clean.
We only spent a night on during holidays.I would say because of the location and because the bed seemed very clean and felt comfortable I think it is worthwhile. No fridge,No microwave,really thin pillow (didn’t bother asking for other type,maybe they had options).,

The location was excellent,the staff was friendly and welcoming. Check in was fast and efficient. The room had high ceilings made it feel very big. The room and bed was clean and comfortable.

7614,6.7,"I had the room out in the carpark and it was really cold. There was a gap under the door that wasn't covered by the curtains and all the cold air and noise was slipping in through there. The heater was working as per thermostat settings but since the bunk bed was closed towards the heater, and the gap was right near the bed.. it wasn't enough. Also, due to the huge interesting bunk bed, there was no space in the room.
The water from the bath tap was hot but wouldn't come hotter to make a decent bath. By the time the bath filled the water had cooled due to not being hot enough. Was okay for a shower though, but we were already really cold and needed to warm up and the bedroom wasn't helping us either.. unfortunately whoever designed this room didn't think the space properly because there was so much space down in the bathroom and nice and warm that I'd had rather slept in there than in the cold and tight bunk bed room above.,

The bedroom had an interesting design.. on 2 levels.. with a huge bunk bed as you walk in and the bathroom on the ground level, right under the bed. One can play with the light in the bathroom and makes it even more interesting.

6017,9.2,"The apartment has a very nice potential, but it lacks the ""final touch"". Some things were not very clean (the floor in some rooms, or the dish washer), the switch for the bed lamp was broken and the electrical wires were visible, so in the dark you could touch them by mistake, the light in the bedroom and the light from the front door were broken and other small things like this.
I did not call the owners for these because those weren't things that bothered me that much.,

The apartment was is located in a very nice and quite place. It is very close to the important places to visit. The welcome was nice, they waited for us with the keys and gave us a short introduction. The apartment is large, with big rooms, it has all the utilities that you would need (kitchen with everything you need). 
If you do not want to cook, you have a lot of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. They do close pretty early, but if you make your program just right you have a nice selection of all types of food. There are also a lot of stores around.
The door to the building closes at around 21 o'clock, but you have keys for all the doors so you can return at any time you desire.

Arrived to a construction site: electrical cables hanging out of walls; antenna cables coming in and out of windows; dead lock in apartment 3 feel apart in our hands (thank goodness we had not yet locked it!); hot water not on in apartment 3; shower drain not connected properly in apartment 2. 
Safety and security is terrible. The door from the street to the building is broken therefore people from the street and nearby night club can enter the common stairwell (and do, at all hours of the night). 
The music and crowd from the night club close by makes sleep impossible. The sensor lights within the apartment come on and off all night without reason. 
It is non-smoking accommodation; however the smoke smells from the restaurant and apartment below enter via the bathroom pipes and permeate the apartments above (particularly apartment 2). People in our group woke up feeling ill from this - we had asthmatic children in our group - even the non-asthmatics were affected by the sickly odour. 
This was our worst Booking.com experience. We all decided it was not worth compromising safety, security and health staying the second night so we checked out first thing the next morning and found alternative accommodation.

22806,5.8,"Location and smell.
The property is right next door to Antwerp Tower which has a lot of work being done on it and they start work around 6am in the morning (not bank holidays and Sundays but they are working early on Saturday morning). 
On arrival, the apartment didn't have a particularly nice smell. This got worse over the stay and it was coming from the drain in the shower. There is no door between the bathroom and the bedroom so it was not that pleasant to sleep in. We bought some gel to put down the drain and aired the room but could not get rid of the smell. We reported it after our first night but it was not sorted despite being told it was being investigated.
We also lost power and after calling the property company, we were requested to go down to the basement to reset it (the fuse box was fine). The property is shared with a restaurant downstairs and luckily we met an employee as we called the lift and they very kindly sorted the power issue for us.,

Location. This property could be rated a lot higher. It has a wonderful central location right on the edge of Antwerp Old Town. We were staying in the top floor penthouse and it has fantastic views out over Antwerp skyline.However, at the moment, it's location is also it's downfall.",1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0

There was a door between the bedroom and this entry area where the motion-sensor light was, so it was not the end of the world.  We would have LOVED it if the room had had a better table for enjoying the wonderful breakfast.  We only had the desk and its one chair, which kind of brought our breakfast enjoyment down a bit (the pandemic rules require that guests eat only in their rooms).  The room was very comfortable, there were hooks in the bathroom and the tilework was all nice and clean, so no real complaints.,

Great small hotel in a suite of very old buildings.  Unique, wonderful architecture, winding hallways and staircases that led to our gigantic family room with a view over a courtyard to fascinating rooflines and a tower!  The hotel was just off the Grand Market, so it had a great location.  There was a city parking garage nearby, which worked for us since we drove.  The staff was absolutely WONDERFUL, very welcoming and accommodating.  The beds and bedding were wonderful, the bathroom was modern and very comfortable.  The breakfast provided was wonderful.

23070,5.8,"No Breakfast in the Morning. Only available few days and breakfast is very limited. The Hotel needs a lot of maintenance and facilities should be upgraded and modernized. The room was a bit worn out and not clean. Beds need to be improved or replaced for comfortable sleeping. The lights in the room need to be brighter and there should be more lights in the room. very difficult for reading or browsing with Dim lights in the room. 
The bathrooms are old-fashioned. The shower in the bathroom was broken and no hair-dryer available. Even the Door is broken and is difficult to lock it sometimes. The TV was not working at all in my room.
The Internet was slow and it needs an upgrade so that you can connect to Wi-FI with just a password valid for all devices.
Now to connect to Wi-FI I had to use a separate Username and Password for each device and it is valid only for 2 days.
The stairways are very narrow and bad considering the safety aspect in case of fire. I had a lot of difficulty in moving my luggage to the room via the very narrow staircase.
Considering all these, I would say it is not worth for the price of 70 Euros per night..,

Pillow was too dense and high for my taste - would be great to have a selection as in the room there are extra pillows anyway. A blanket is to warm for me, but I have this issue almost everywhere - growing up behind a polar circuit doesn't help me in this case. Bed cover is that half-synthetic thing with a rubber around mattress, doesn't breath really well, but people there are very used to them, so you'll see them a lot. Room is right under the roof and it could be quite hot inside on a sunny days and small windows won't allow to move this hot air out fast. Overall it all may look small to you and you won't even notice, I believe I've just spoiled myself sleeping on fresh chill air in all-natural bedroom at home, that is why I was too shy to tell Els and Tom all that personally.,

Exceptional breakfast, nice owners, perfect location to work in Bornem. Fast WiFi (~20 Mbps) by local standards, although signal strength could be improved.

The check-in lady got really mean and angry with her saying, ""it was a welcome drink and that she'd already had a drink."" There wasn't a sign posted ANYWHERE to indicate that and further more, she never mentioned or offered it to us at check in.

While walking around outside its easy to forget that you're actually in Europe; the hotel is close to a train station; at night there are a lot of drug addicts, homeless and gipsies on the streets, sleeping outside or talking to you if you walk by. They come in big numbers. If you travel by car, especially one having a ''foreign'' license plate, it is highly advised to park it in the hotel garage. This costs you €25.

When i spoke to staff they appeared to be looking in to it but really did nothing about it, instead advising us to use reception’s WiFi. There was no modem on 3rd floor and the one of 4th floor had no power so I feel that it has been the case for a while. 
One of the staff made me feel that my complaint was not warranted as WiFi was ‘free therefore I should be grateful’ and it was not my right to complain given they have an alternative. 
The bathroom screen was also broken so water ran all over bathroom floor and flooded the main room, under the bed and so on. Make sure you place towels on the floor to prevent this. 
Rooms don’t have air con so if you are staying in the peak of summer, ask for corner room or you may be sleeping with your door open which we saw a few people do.

This B&B is clearly a labour of love. Sharon is a top-notch host, and one of the sweetest, most caring and sincere owners of a B&B we have met.

There is also a great little grocery store a few minutes walk away if you need any provisions. Water, tea, coffee, milk (for your tea or coffee) and beer are all available for you in the kitchen and Sharon asks you to make yourself at home. There were even chocolates on the bed when we arrived in our room.  The only downside is that there is a shared bathroom, not an issue during our visit since we were the only guests that night but not something we noticed when we booked and something that we usually avoid. Sharon has gone to efforts to make this work with robes in each room for guests transiting to and from the facilities, an ‘in use or available’ sign on the door and space for storage of toiletries etc assigned for each room in the bathroom.

The room was nice and had everything we needed, but the double bed didn’t have a proper frame so was on the floor. That may not be a problem for many people, but for me it was because I have very bad knees and can’t get up easily from the floor. Also, the bathroom was very nice but has a metal floor (I assume so that it’s easy to clean), which was VERY cold in the winter.

The owner/hoast brought the butter promptly but since she only speaks French (*very* little English), communication was difficult. On day 2, I used Google translate which was a lot better to communicate.   ANOTHER issue is the funky heater/Fireplace which burns pellets.  The instructions are non-existent and the explanation by the owner is in French.   What she needs to do is create ENGLISH instructions for the fireplace/heater.  Putting it on/off a few times results in heater damage (which is what happened) and the owner gave me a temporary electric heater.  That worked but was not half as charming!!,

There was no note/email upfront or a small briefing when we checked in. Which would have been kind.
Therefore we couldn't enjoy a swim. I shared this with the lady of the reception during checkout, but her only response was: ah yes it will be fixed next week. But what's that helping me? No apologies or something.. Normally I wouldn't have cared too much, but now since it was the reason of my choice it wasn't nice.
That's the only minor. Besides this, all was well. Just bad luck I guess.,

Due to the position of the fireplace, windows, etc, it would be difficult to move the bed to another position but it meant our heads were only a few metres away from people going up and down the stairs. Other guests were very respectful so we slept well until being woken up by a staff member refilling the coffee and tea cupboard just outside our door at 8am. After 10 minutes or so of trying to ignore her I got up and to let her know that we were trying to sleep. To her credit, she went elsewhere immediately.
I don't believe this would be an issue in other rooms, only room 2. And this was only an issue for us because we were really looking forward to catching up on our sleep and the check out was not until 11am. ,

2 minutes later the 5th staff member approached and I now tend to think that she was a trainee - that's probably why we were asked to wait for her specifically. It really seemed like she wasn't experienced, because she didn't mention all the necessary things, but the most outrageous is that when we asked her if the breakfast was included, she said ""Yes"". The next morning we went to have breakfast, and then we were checking out. The same lady told us the amount and that we need to pay extra for the breakfast!

If you have any walking issues, this may be difficult, and we decided that even though it was short we would drive.,

When I've gone to the receptionist to comment about it, immediately went to handle it.
All my thanks!! That's how a situation should always be managed!
Didn't like that the distance between the lower and the upper beds, was really short. I'm tall, and there's no chance I could sit normally... or any way without be very bowed.

After I complained I was given a room with air-con which made a huge difference.  I really do like this hotel, but with a caveat: in the summer you MUST insist on air-con or book elsewhere.  Also the wifi drops out more often than it should I think.,

Staff are excellent - really helpful.  Gardens are beautiful and peaceful, backing onto the World Heritage Site (Great Begijnhof Spanish Quarter).  Location very good for me as I was sitting an exam in the university.  I enjoyed my stay after the initial problem of air-con was sorted.

On this first revieuw the owner defended himself with lies like:
Warning!!this client didn’t see the mezzanine with the 2 single beds!!(see on the pictures in the booking.com site!!).So there are 2 rooms!!
Moreover he was alone and paid for a single occupancy,so why should he need 2 rooms?
This is really frustrating to get such a dishonest comment!!
But: I booked this room with my partner and an a extra guests so not alone if he can see in the booking.
That's why we need two rooms.
No problem if it were two separate rooms as the owner reports but that is not the case.
You have to reach the second room by scrambling through a scary dangerous ladder to a attic that looks out onto the double bed of the other room. 
SO PRIVICY ZERO.

More importantly, in the morning, when we asked the staff if we could leave our luggage at the hostel until the check-in time and use the restroom very quickly (as we just had arrived at Brugge that morning after a long trip), one of the staff kindly allowed us in but the other member started a loud argument with him in Dutch (which made us extremely uncomfortable) and basically kicked us out before we could use the restroom. This has nothing to do with the service we paid for (after all, we were there before the check-in time, before the reception was open). However, it kind of ruined our experience at the place before our stay even began.,

It was a lovely facility, located at the very centre of Brugge. The rooms were clean; the lounge and the kitchen (although the oven was broken) were easily available.

Also, I've stayed in various rooms, and every one has had an annoying flaw, a different one in each occasion. This time it was toilet that would not stop flushing.,

The hotel is well placed if you have business around Schuman and like to take the airport bus. The room is big, kept perfectly clean, has many useful amenities such as microwave, plates, tea kettle. On the plus side, they provide free toiletries during the stay, but keep only providing one packet of tea on the first day only no matter how long you stay (which used to be the case also with the toiletries, so hurray for the progress!).

I asked for a new room that same morning and they said no, I asked in the evening and they said they only change rooms during the day. The morning after at 6 am the noise woke me up and I went to the reception where someone decided to make me pack my stuff  and that they would change my room. Which was one similar. Better looking but same noise coming from the floor above. I could not sleep until midnight and the morning after at 6.30 noise woke me. Having someone flushing the toilet on your head is disgusting.

I've spent from 5th to 9th of July in this amazing b&b: it's set on Belgium country, but at the same time in a strategic position to reach each single corner of Belgium (we drove also to Amsterdam in 2:30 hrs..!). It's an old house completely renovated by Bernard and Martine: ask to them to show a small book with lot of pictures taken during renovation.
Every morning breakfast was a pleasure: fresh fruit, home made cake, sweets taken fresh every morning, italian coffee served hot, plus home made marmelades, yoghurt, omelette... the best way to start every sightseeing tour on a city!
Rooms are very tidy, with a beautiful bathroom with a giant shower with a view on country side (every morning we saw many rabbits!! so cue!!). Coffe and fresh water are complimentary all day long!
In conclusion:  I've never seen a b&b so tidy, familiar and beautiful (with a real affordable price) like this one!
Thanks so much to Martine and Bernard!

One morning they had even run out of drinking water in the spa and I was informed that delivery would come after 12 o’clock, so several hours later! It took a few discussions and phone calls to arrange for bottle water instead. The crew was almost irritated by me asking although I had just come out sweaty from the gym. A few tips from my side:
• The tiny sport facility is a separate space. Put a water dispenser there, provide towels and keep it open around the clock! The spa can still be closed independently.
• Train your staff to understand the guests’ needs and think a little bit outside the box. Pay them extra for smiling, talking friendly and looking people in the eyes. 
• Make sure your supplies are efficient and your staff pro-active to keep the guests happy. It doesn’t take much!,

We have just enjoyed the most magical stay in Bonifacius. We were greeted on arrival by Lynn and she was so welcoming. She immediately offered us secure parking for our car, and once that was sorted we were treated to champagne as Lynn welcomed us and explained everything we needed to know. We had a beautiful room overlooking the canal and Our Lady's Church and Bonifacius Bridge. Again the best words that come to mind is just magical.
The room decor is beautiful and so in keeping with the medieval house. The bathroom offered comfort and luxury with all Hermes products.
Lynn looking after us so well and served us a beautiful breakfast each morning. She also helped us sort out food options for the evening as the restaurants were closed. 
My Fiance  is so in love with B&B Bonifacius we are booking in again for next Christmas.
Brugge is a very special place to visit and B&B Bonifacius to us the perfect place to stay and explore this medieval town.
